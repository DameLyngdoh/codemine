This is a collection of coding problems I've encountered throughout my coding experience and I want to share them with you and the solutions I came up. These problems are solved in Java, but they can be easily translated to *C++* or *Python*.

There may be mistakes or even logical errors in the solutions. If you find such, please let me know by using the **Issues** section.

Please note that the solutions follow partial industry coding standards. Do not use the code in the solutions as references for best practices or coding standards. These solutions are meant to simplify the interpretation of the solution and the algorithm used.
